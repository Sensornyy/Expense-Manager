# Expense Manager
App for tracking your expenses

## Purpose of the project

This app may help people to control their spendings. My task was to create custom Chart that can show amount of money that was spend in last week. You can specify any day of the transaction in a convenient calendar when adding a transaction to the listю Also, you can remove the transaction from the list below by long press. Chart will change dynamically.
To avoid bugs, validation of input fields has been created.

## Technologies that involved:
